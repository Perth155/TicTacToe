# TicTacToe

## Compiling and running the game:
A very simple 2-player command line based Object Oriented tic-tac-toe game written in Java. 
Currently supports game between two human players, or versing the computer which is using pseudorandom numbers.
To compile TicTacToe.java, open terminal on the same directory and type:
```
javac TicTacToe.java
```
Then simply run the .class file that is generated
```
java TicTacToe
```
Enjoy!


## Known bugs:
* Game crashes with any non-integer console input by user.

## TODO:
* Implement an unbeatable AI using minimax algorithm, and allow human player to verse the computer. 
* Implement a GUI (optional).
